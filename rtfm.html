  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The weapon skill mechanics are implemented assuming the information in <a href="https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/">this source</a> is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      All weapon damage is averaged, there is no point in wasting time RNGing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Things that are working so far:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic setup wih UI, Web Worker and main loop
        </li>
        <li>
          Combat mechanics, including target level, weapon skill etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raw damage calculations and Flurry
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic rage mechanics (need to double check the numbers)
        </li>
        <li>
          Heroic Strike and the <a href="https://github.com/SunwellTracker/issues/issues/2170">heroic strike bug</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic logging and results
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lots of things are still missing. In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Custom talent spec, Anger Management, Unbridled Wrath, Deep Wounds (Impale is in)
        </li>
        <li>
          Custom rotation, Hamstring spam, slam etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Character and target level selection (hardcoded to 60 and 63)
        </li>
        <li>
          Two-hand weapons and daggers
        </li>
        <li>
          Armor and armor reduction (Bonereaver's Edge)
        </li>
        <li>
          Heroic Strike rank IX from Dire Maul
        </li>
        <li>
          Procs (Crusader, Windfury and Hand of Justice in particular)
        </li>
        <li>
          ...
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
