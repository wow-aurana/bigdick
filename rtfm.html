  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The weapon skill mechanics are implemented assuming the information in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/">this source</a> is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      All weapon damage is averaged, there is no point in wasting time RNGing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code makes a number of assumptions that are not necessarily verified yet:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Due to lack of data, all weapon procs are assumed to be 1ppm for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rage is a floating point number, rage gains and losses are not rounded to whole numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra swings like Hand of Justice and Windfury Totem are regular attacks, that suffer the dual-wield hit penalty and can be glancing blows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra swings like Hand of Justice and Windfury Totem *do* consume Flurry charges; Ironfoe proc consumes up to two Flurry charges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra swings like Hand of Justice and Windfury Totem can be Heroic Strikes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The attack power buff from Windfury Totem applies to other swings that happen a short time after (see <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/7">here</a> for details).
        </li>
        <li>
          All procs, including extra attacks always happen after the actual event that triggered them. In particular, an attack will *not* profit form the strength buff of a Crusader proc that it itself caused.
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra attack procs cannot proc each other, although they can all proc on the same swing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dodged and parried white swings generate 75% of the rage that a normal hit would have; misses generate 0 rage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Glancing blows generate rage proportional to their damage, which means depending on your weapon skill, a glancing blow could generate less rage than a dodge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Slam rage costs are checked at the start of the cast, but the rage is subtracted at the end of the cast.
        </li>
        <li>
          All abilities except Whirlwind refund 80% of their rage costs if they are dodged/parried/miss.
        </li>
        <li>
          Execute refunds 84% of its total cost rather than 80% (needs testing).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lots of things are still missing. In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some relevant procs (Bonereaver's Edge, Lifestealing, Demonslaying...)
        </li>
        <li>
          Overpower, Deep Wounds and Deathwish
        </li>
        <li>
          Arms and Prot specs
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacking from the front
        </li>
        <li>
          Heroic Strike rank IX from Dire Maul
        </li>
        <li>
          ...
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
