  <h1>Notes</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The weapon skill mechanics are implemented assuming the information in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/">this source</a> is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
      All weapon damage is averaged, there is no point in wasting time RNGing it.
    </li>
    <li>
      The code makes a number of assumptions that are not necessarily verified yet:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Rage is a floating point number, rage gains and losses are not rounded to whole numbers
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra swings like Hand of Justice and Windfury totem are regular attacks, that suffer the dual-wield hit penalty and can be glancing blows
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra swings like Hand of Justice and Windfury totem do *not* consume Flurry charges
        </li>
        <li>
          The attack power buff from Windfury Totem does not apply to other swings that happen a short time after
        </li>
        <li>
          All procs, including extra attacks always happen before the actual event that triggered them. In particular, an attack will profit form the attack power buff of a Crusader proc that it itself caused
        </li>
        <li>
          Extra attack procs cannot proc each other, although they can all proc on the same event
        </li>
        <li>
          Dodged and parried white swings generate 75% of the rage that a normal hit would have
        </li>
        <li>
          Glancing blows generate rage proportional to their damage, which means depending on your weapon skill, a glancing blow could generate less rage than a dodge
        </li>
        <li>
          Slam rage costs are checked at the start of the cast, but the rage is subtracted at the end of the cast
        </li>
        <li>
          All abilities except Heroic strike and Whirlwind refund 84% of their rage costs if they are dodged/parried but not when they miss.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Things that are working so far:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Basic setup with UI, Web Worker and main loop
        </li>
        <li>
          Combat mechanics, including target level, weapon skill etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Raw damage calculations for all common Fury specs
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic <a target="_blank" href="https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Rage#Rage_conversion_value">rage mechanics</a> (need to double check the numbers)
        </li>
        <li>
          Most commonly used damage Abilites
        </li>
        <li>
          Two-hand weapons
        </li>
        <li>
          Hand of Justice, Windfury Totem and Crusader enchant
        </li>
        <li>
          Parsing talent spec from a link
        </li>
        <li>
          Anger Management and Unbridled Wrath
        </li>
        <li>
          Basic logging and results
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Lots of things are still missing. In particular:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some relevant procs (Thrash Blade, Flurry Axe, Lifestealing, Demonslaying...)
        </li>
        <li>
          Overpower, Deep Wounds, Bloodrage and Deathwish
        </li>
        <li>
          Arms and Prot specs
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacking from the front
        </li>
        <li>
          Armor and armor reduction (<a target="_blank" href="https://classicdb.ch/?item=17076">Bonereaver's Edge</a>, <a  target="_blank" href="https://classicdb.ch/?item=12798">Annihilator</a> etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Heroic Strike rank IX from Dire Maul
        </li>
        <li>
          Daggers
        </li>
        <li>
          Execute does not yet refund rage on misses
        </li>
        <li>
          Blessing of Kings (relevant for Crusader proc)
        </li>
        <li>
          ...
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
